# We've moved back to `parse`!

With pull request https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse/pull/165 merged, this fork and its distribution are no longer required to use the `datetime` feature of the `parse` library.

The `fparse` project has now been archived and we recommend users to go to the main `parse` library instead.
